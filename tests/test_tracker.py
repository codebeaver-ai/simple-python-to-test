Here's my thought process for creating a new test function:

First, I'll need to import the ExpenseTracker class from the expense_tracker module, since that's what I want to test. I'll wrap this in an ```imports block.

```imports
from expense_tracker import ExpenseTracker
```

Looking at the coverage report, it seems the existing tests (if any) already cover the basic functionality pretty well. To increase coverage, I could test some of the error handling, like trying to add an expense with an invalid category.

I'll define a new test function called test_add_expense_invalid_category(). Inside it, I'll create an instance of ExpenseTracker. Then I'll use pytest.raises() to check that a ValueError is raised when I try to add an expense with an invalid category. I'll write this test code and wrap it in a ```test block.

```test
def test_add_expense_invalid_category():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Category must be one of:"):
        tracker.add_expense(50.0, "invalid category", "Test expense")
```

This test tries to add an expense with a category of "invalid category", which is not in the allowed categories. It checks that a ValueError is raised with the expected error message.

To use pytest.raises(), I'll need to import pytest. I'll add that to the ```imports block.

```imports
import pytest
```

Finally, I'll also import pytest.fixture so I can use fixtures if needed in future tests. The complete ```imports block is:

```imports
import pytest
from expense_tracker import ExpenseTracker
```

And the complete new test function is:

```test
def test_add_expense_invalid_category():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Category must be one of:"):
        tracker.add_expense(50.0, "invalid category", "Test expense")
```

This standalone test file should increase the coverage by testing the error handling for adding an expense with an invalid category. Let me know if you have any other questions!
