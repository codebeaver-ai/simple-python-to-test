To increase the test coverage, I'll write a test function that covers the add_category method of the ExpenseTracker class. This method allows adding a new expense category to the tracker.

Reasoning:
- I'll need to import the ExpenseTracker class from the expense_tracker module to use it in the test.
- I'll create an instance of the ExpenseTracker class in the test function.
- I'll test adding a new category using the add_category method and assert that it returns True.
- I'll also test adding a category that already exists and assert that it returns False.
- I'll test adding an empty or non-string category and assert that it raises a ValueError.

Here's the test code with imports:

```imports
from expense_tracker import ExpenseTracker
import pytest
```

```test
def test_add_category():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    
    # Test adding a new category
    assert tracker.add_category("shopping") == True
    assert "shopping" in tracker.categories
    
    # Test adding an existing category
    assert tracker.add_category("food") == False
    
    # Test adding an empty or non-string category
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        tracker.add_category("")
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        tracker.add_category(123)
```

Explanation:
- I imported the ExpenseTracker class from the expense_tracker module to use it in the test.
- I also imported pytest to use the pytest.raises context manager for testing exceptions.
- In the test function, I created an instance of the ExpenseTracker class.
- I tested adding a new category "shopping" using the add_category method and asserted that it returns True and the category is added to the categories set.
- I tested adding an existing category "food" and asserted that it returns False.
- I used the pytest.raises context manager to test adding an empty category and a non-string category (integer), and asserted that it raises a ValueError.

This test function covers the add_category method and should increase the test coverage of the ExpenseTracker class.
